The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

The client was The Gaming Room, a company that owns the game Draw It or Lose It, originally developed as an Android-only application. They wanted a web-based, multi-platform version of the game that could run on various operating systems and devices. Key requirements included supporting multiple teams and players, enforcing unique team names, and ensuring only one active game instance runs in memory at a time. The goal was to improve accessibility, scalability, and overall performance while allowing the business to reach a wider audience.

What I Did Well

I did particularly well comparing different operating systems and platforms, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and then selecting Linux as the best hosting environment. I clearly justified my decision by backing it up with technical reasoning related to scalability, performance, and cost efficiency.

How the Design Document Helped

Working through the design document helped reinforce what I needed to implement in the code. It clearly outlined expectations from the server, operating system, and customer perspectives, which made the coding process more structured and easier to follow.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the depth and clarity of some explanations, especially around how the architecture supports scalability and future growth. I would add more concrete examples and tighten the wording to make the document even more professional.

Interpreting User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by considering multiple perspectives the end user, the developer, and the company’s future growth. This included usability, system efficiency, and the ability to expand or adapt the software later. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the software is functional, scalable, and aligned with business goals rather than just technically correct.

My Software Design Approach

I approached designing the software by evaluating all available options and eliminating those that did not meet the project’s criteria. I focused on selecting technologies that best supported scalability, performance, and maintainability.

Future Strategies

In the future, I would use the same comparison-based strategy, but much more efficiently. With a stronger understanding of what each operating system and platform is best suited for, I can analyze requirements faster and arrive at well-supported design decisions more quickly.
